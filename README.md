## Predictive Maintenance of Aircraft Landing Gear Using Physics-Informed Digital Twin Data and Machine Learning

---

## Abstract

This project investigates the use of supervised machine learning methods for predictive maintenance of aircraft landing gear systems. A physics-informed digital twin dataset is used to model event-level landing operations. The objective is to evaluate whether machine learning models can support condition-based maintenance strategies in safety-critical aviation systems.

## Problem Statement

Landing gear failures often develop gradually and may not be detected by traditional time-based maintenance approaches. The research question addressed in this project is:

Can machine learning models trained on physics-informed digital twin data reliably detect abnormal landing gear conditions at the event level?
